## 🎯 What is this degen shit?

**wallet wrapped** is like Spotify Wrapped but for your Ethereum wallet. Drop your address and get a sick summary of your on-chain degeneracy:

- 💰 **Top Bags** - Your biggest holdings (and biggest mistakes)
- 📈 **Best Trades** - When you actually made it (rare)
- 🖼️ **NFT Flexes** - Your JPEG collection worth more than your car
- 💸 **Rug Pulls** - The tokens that went to zero (RIP)
- 🔥 **Degen Score** - How much of a true degen you really are

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (for the nerds)

- **Next.js 14** - Because we're not savages
- **TypeScript** - Type safety in this economy?
- **Tailwind CSS** - Making it look clean AF
- **Vercel Blob** - Storing your shame
- **AI SDK** - GPT-4 roasting your trades
- **Ethereum APIs** - The blockchain never lies

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this bad boy**
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/wallet-wrapped.git
   cd wallet-wrapped
   \`\`\`

2. **Install dependencies** (npm install but make it degen)
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   # or if you're a yarn maxi
   yarn install
   \`\`\`

3. **Set up your environment** 
   \`\`\`bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Add your API keys (don't leak them, anon)
   \`\`\`

4. **Run it locally**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

5. **Open http://localhost:3000** and start flexing

## 🔧 Environment Variables

You'll need these to make the magic happen:

\`\`\`env
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
# Add more as needed for your degen analytics
\`\`\`

## Issues
- Vercel's ai sdk only seems to output structured output will tools on gpt-4o
- Verbosity of some tool calls leading to quick rate limits
- OpenSea's MCP does not do well with time queries, so queries are time independent
- Getting majorly rate limited by OpenAi
